# goal-tracker

Goal-tracker is a practice project that is partially done coding along with the Udemy course, and partially on my own.
On my own, I added a custom hook for Input validation, custom styling, modal and adjusted the logic that is presented in the course.
Creating this app I learned to collect user input, and how to dynamically render content.      
Goal-tracker is a combination of two projects with similar logic, input fields, and a dynamically rended list. 
So I added Modal from another practice project, and combine it into one.
