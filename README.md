# goal-tracker

Goal-tracker is an app that is partially done coding along with the Udemy course, and partially on my own.
On my own, I added a custom hook for Input validation, custom styling, and adjusted the logic that is presented in the course.
Creating this app I learned to collect user input, and how to dynamically render content.
